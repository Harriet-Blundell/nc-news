## General Information:

My Northcoders News project is a RESTful API that will function as my back-end.

It will serve as a social news aggregate website where users can rate content and have discussions in the style of Reddit.

For this project, I used PostgreSQL database to store the data and interacted with it by using Knex.js for query building and migrations.

The link to my Heroku API is: http://harrietblundell-be-nc-news.herokuapp.com/api

## Step 1 - Getting Started:

This section will explain how you can get a copy of this repository to run on your machine.

Firstly, you will need to fork this repository, clone it to your machine and then open it up in your chosen code editor in your terminal.

In your terminal:

```bash
git clone <link>

cd <name of folder>
```

## Step 2 - Prerequisites:

In order to get started, you will need Node.js and NPM installed on your machine.

If you are unsure about whether you have these installed, type the following command into your terminal:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

If both of these commands show a version number, then you have them installed, if not then go into your terminal and type:

```bash
sudo apt install nodejs
sudo apt install npm
```

Once all you have installed Node.js and NPM, type in the following command in your terminal:

- This will create a package.json file for this project

```bash
npm init -y
```

After this has been installed, type in the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm i
```

The above command will install the following Node modules that are required for this project:

```bash
cors v2.8.5
express v4.17.1
knex v0.20.4
pg v7.14.0
chai v4.2.0
chai-sorted v0.2.0
mocha v6.2.2
nodemon v2.0.1
supertest v4.0.2
```

## Step 3 - Running the tests:

Run the following command in your terminal to test all of the endpoints:

```bash
npm test
```

## Step 4 - Built With:

- JavaScript
- PostgreSQL database - Used to create the database
- Knex - Used for migrations and query building
- Heroku

## Deployment:

I used Heroku because it allowed for easy database integration and a service that I could push my code to, build it, and host my API.

## Step 5 - RESTful API:

This section will explain all the available endpoints in this RESTful API.

```bash
GET /api/topics
POST /api/topics

GET /api/users
POST /api/users
GET /api/users/:username

GET /api/articles/:article_id
PATCH /api/articles/:article_id

POST /api/articles/:article_id/comments
GET /api/articles/:article_id/comments

GET /api/articles
POST /api/articles

PATCH /api/comments/:comment_id
DELETE /api/comments/:comment_id

GET /api
